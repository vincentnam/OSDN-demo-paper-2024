Description </strong></p>\n<p>The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) views the products of its research including\nresearch dataset(s) as global public goods and is committed to enabling their widespread distribution\nand use by providing unrestricted public access. This is in keeping with the <a href=\"https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/133308/filename/133517.pdf\">IFPRI Research Data\nManagement and Open Access (RDMOA) Policy</a> and the <a href=\"https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/4488/Open%20Access%20Data%20Management%20Policy.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\">CGIAR Open Access and Data Management\nPolicy </a> (each, a “Policy” and together, the “Policies”).</p>\n<p>IFPRI makes all its research data publicly available through the “IFPRI Dataverse.” The IFPRI Dataverse\nhouses and is comprised of datasets collected during the course of IFPRI research, including data tables\nin various standard formats, survey instruments, codebooks, metadata, and other associated\ndocumentation. IFPRI Dataverse is a network member of Harvard Dataverse, which is a repository for\nresearch data hosted at <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/\">Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS)</a>, Harvard University.</p>\n<p>IFPRI is the owner of the “IFPRI Dataverse” (sometimes referred to in these Terms of Use as the “Site”).\nThe Communications and Public Affairs (CPA) division of IFPRI operates this Site on behalf of IFPRI.

To capture these various effects on household welfare, this phone survey was conducted with (around) 500 individuals randomly drawn from an existing list of phone numbers collected from previous household surveys with an equal proportion of women and men. The same individuals were also interviewed during other rounds to generate a longitudinal panel allowing for analysis of the impact of COVID-19 through time."
